# Nolan's Games App
##Overview
This is the front end repository for my online games page, live at [https://nolans-games.netlify.app/](https://nolans-games.netlify.app/).
The front end was built using React. 
Currently live on the website are Minesweeper and Tic-Tac-Toe. 
Games that are multiplayer require an account to be created with the website. 
You can find the back end repository [here](https://github.com/NolanReedHill/Games-Backend).
